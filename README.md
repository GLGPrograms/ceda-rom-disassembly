# Sanco 8003 ROM disassembly
This is the ROM disassembly for the Sanco 8003, a French computer from 1982.

This project's codename _ceda-rom-disassembly_ comes from the letters on proud shiny sticker glued to our computer, which probably just stands for _Centro Elaborazione Dati_ (Italian for datacenter).

## Variables
See [Variables](Variables.md).

## Re-Assemble
Install [z88dk](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk), then:
```
make
```

If you introduce any modification, a CI job will make sure that the final binary won't change.

We need your help. No, seriously, send help, this is pure madness. There are many ways:
- send documentation
- send software/disk
- disassembly something and open a PR
